# Lab 5: integration

For lab 5 you will extend the functionality of your FlatSAT. 

Select one of these ideas (a single bullet/subpoint), or propose your own idea to your instructor. 



- combine concepts and capabilities of two previous labs
- implement an existing lab on a propeller 2 microcontroller (C++ or spin2) 
- extend electrical lab
  - measure capacity of an 18650 Li-ion cell
  - characterize IV curve of FalconSAT cells at different temperatures
- extend communication lab
  - add 2 new functions (like turning on the LED)
  - add capability to inject errors into serial stream
  - add error correction
  - characterize antenna radiation pattern (nulls, polarization)
  - transmit file stored on SDcard (xmodem, ymodem, or zmodem)
- extend attitude lab
  - add electromagnet to FlatSAT
  - characterize electromagnet hysteresis
  - calibrate magnetometer in situ (automatically while it’s in FlatSAT, instead of post-processing the calibration)
  - add closed-loop pointing
    - follow light with photodetectors
    - follow programmed pointing sequence
  - characterize reaction wheel response and controllability from $-\omega$ to $\omega$ 
- develop robust thermal lab
- extend remote sensing lab
  - get 5 MP arducam to work
  - store multiple images on SD card

### proposal

By the end of class on the project work day, submit a written proposal to your instructor. Your instructor will approve or modify your proposal. 



### procedures and prelab report

By the start of class on the integration lab execution day, submit your prelab report. This is a group product (not individual effort). 

The *Experimental Setup* section of your prelab report should be a summary of how you will accomplish your lab. You must also have a separate file of thorough lab procedures, similar to the provided instructions from labs 1–4. 



### lab report

Write a lab report with your experimental results and conclusions.
